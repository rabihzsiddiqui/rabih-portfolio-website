            I&apos;m a UC San Diego graduate with a degree in Cognitive Science,
            interested in the space where design, psychology, and engineering
            meet. I enjoy building clean, thoughtful interfaces and
            understanding how people actually use the things we create.

            Right now, I&apos;m coding regularly and working through
            professional certificates in Google UX Design, Meta Front-End
            Development, and IBM Mobile App Development. My goal is to keep
            strengthening both how I think about products and how I build them.
